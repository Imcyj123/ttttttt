# Introduction

Your introduction goes here! Simply start writing your document and use
the Recompile button to view the updated PDF preview. Examples of
commonly used commands and features are listed below, to help you get
started.

Once you're familiar with the editor, you can find various project
settings in the Overleaf menu, accessed via the button in the very top
left of the editor. To view tutorials, user guides, and further
documentation, please visit our [help
library](https://www.overleaf.com/learn), or head to our plans page to
[choose your plan](https://www.overleaf.com/user/subscription/plans).

# Some examples to get started

## How to create Sections and Subsections

Simply use the section and subsection commands, as in this example
document! With Overleaf, all the formatting and numbering is handled
automatically according to the template you've chosen. If you're using
the Visual Editor, you can also create new section and subsections via
the buttons in the editor toolbar.

## How to include Figures

First you have to upload the image file from your computer using the
upload link in the file-tree menu. Then use the includegraphics command
to include it in your document. Use the figure environment and the
caption command to add a number and a caption to your figure. See the
code for Figure [1](#fig:frog){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:frog"} in this section for an example.

Note that your figure will automatically be placed in the most
appropriate place for it, given the surrounding text and taking into
account other figures or tables that may be close by. You can find out
more about adding images to your documents in this help article on
[including images on
Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/how-to/Including_images_on_Overleaf).

## How to add Tables

Use the table and tabular environments for basic tables --- see
Table [1](#tab:widgets){reference-type="ref" reference="tab:widgets"},
for example. For more information, please see this help article on
[tables](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/tables).

::: {#tab:widgets}
  Item        Quantity
  --------- ----------
  Widgets           42
  Gadgets           13

  : An example table.

## How to add Comments and Track Changes

Comments can be added to your project by highlighting some text and
clicking "Add comment" in the top right of the editor pane. To view
existing comments, click on the Review menu in the toolbar above. To
reply to a comment, click on the Reply button in the lower right corner
of the comment. You can close the Review pane by clicking its name on
the toolbar when you're done reviewing for the time being.

Track changes are available on all our [premium
plans](https://www.overleaf.com/user/subscription/plans), and can be
toggled on or off using the option at the top of the Review pane. Track
changes allow you to keep track of every change made to the document,
along with the person making the change.

## How to add Lists

You can make lists with automatic numbering ...

## How to write Mathematics

LaTeX is great at typesetting mathematics. Let $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$
be a sequence of independent and identically distributed random
variables with $\text{E}[X_i] = \mu$ and
$\text{Var}[X_i] = \sigma^2 < \infty$, and let
$$S_n = \frac{X_1 + X_2 + \cdots + X_n}{n}
      = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i}^{n} X_i$$ denote their mean. Then as $n$
approaches infinity, the random variables $\sqrt{n}(S_n - \mu)$ converge
in distribution to a normal $\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$.

## How to change the margins and paper size

Usually the template you're using will have the page margins and paper
size set correctly for that use-case. For example, if you're using a
journal article template provided by the journal publisher, that
template will be formatted according to their requirements. In these
cases, it's best not to alter the margins directly.

If however you're using a more general template, such as this one, and
would like to alter the margins, a common way to do so is via the
geometry package. You can find the geometry package loaded in the
preamble at the top of this example file, and if you'd like to learn
more about how to adjust the settings, please visit this help article on
[page size and
margins](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/page_size_and_margins).

## How to change the document language and spell check settings

Overleaf supports many different languages, including multiple different
languages within one document.

To configure the document language, simply edit the option provided to
the babel package in the preamble at the top of this example project. To
learn more about the different options, please visit this help article
on [international language
support](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/International_language_support).

To change the spell check language, simply open the Overleaf menu at the
top left of the editor window, scroll down to the spell check setting,
and adjust accordingly.

## How to add Citations and a References List

You can simply upload a `.bib` file containing your BibTeX entries,
created with a tool such as JabRef. You can then cite entries from it,
like this: [@greenwade93]. Just remember to specify a bibliography
style, as well as the filename of the `.bib`. You can find a [video
tutorial
here](https://www.overleaf.com/help/97-how-to-include-a-bibliography-using-bibtex)
to learn more about BibTeX.

If you have an [upgraded
account](https://www.overleaf.com/user/subscription/plans), you can also
import your Mendeley or Zotero library directly as a `.bib` file, via
the upload menu in the file-tree.
